## Module Summary

Customer support in a global EOR/COR company is not a cost center that answers phones. It is the operational nerve center where every upstream failure — payroll errors, compliance gaps, onboarding delays, payment failures — becomes visible through the voice of the person it hurt. If payroll operations is the engine, customer support is the dashboard warning light, the diagnostic port, and the customer-facing repair shop all at once.

What makes support uniquely complex in this industry is the **dual customer base**. You serve two fundamentally different populations with different needs, different communication expectations, and different escalation paths:

- **Workers** — the individuals who depend on your platform for their livelihood. When a worker's net pay is wrong, their rent payment bounces. When their benefits enrollment fails, their child's medical appointment gets canceled. The emotional stakes are personal and immediate. Workers span dozens of countries, speak different languages, have different cultural expectations for service interactions, and in many cases do not understand why their employer's name on the payslip is an entity they have never heard of.

- **Clients** — the companies that pay you to employ these workers. Client contacts are HR leaders, finance teams, and founders. They care about SLA adherence, reporting accuracy, onboarding speed, and whether your platform makes them look competent to the people they hired. When support fails a client, the conversation shifts from "fix this ticket" to "we're evaluating alternatives."

This module builds your understanding of how EOR/COR companies structure, measure, and optimize their support operations. By the end, you will understand:

- How tiered support models work across countries, languages, and time zones
- How ticket analytics and NLP-based classification turn support data into operational intelligence
- How SLAs are structured, measured, and enforced — and why penalty structures vary by client tier
- How quality scoring and CSAT measurement drive agent coaching and process improvement
- How self-service and deflection strategies reduce cost while maintaining satisfaction
- How support data becomes a product signal that identifies missing features and broken processes
- How escalation management prevents regulatory risk and executive churn events
- How workforce planning models predict ticket volume and optimize staffing
- How to build a support analytics function that transforms reactive ticket-handling into predictive operations

**The business case is stark.** Support cost per worker typically runs $8-$25/month. For a platform managing 20,000 workers, that is $160,000-$500,000/month in support spend. But the cost of *poor* support is far higher: a single enterprise client churning because of repeated support failures can represent $500,000-$2,000,000 in annual recurring revenue lost. The analytics leader who can simultaneously reduce support cost AND improve outcomes is building a career-defining capability.
