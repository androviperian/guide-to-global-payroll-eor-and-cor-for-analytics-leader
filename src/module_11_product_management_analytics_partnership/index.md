## Module Summary

If Modules 1 through 10 gave you the operational, compliance, financial, and technical foundations of the global payroll / EOR / COR industry, this module answers a different question: **how do you build products in this space, and how does the analytics function serve the people building them?**

Product management in EOR/COR/payroll is unlike product management in a typical SaaS company. In most SaaS, the PM's primary constraint is user demand versus engineering capacity. In payroll, the PM's primary constraint is **regulatory reality**. You cannot ship a payroll feature that violates tax law. You cannot launch a country that you do not have the legal infrastructure to support. You cannot A/B test a gross-to-net calculation. The compliance tail wags the product dog.

This creates a fundamentally different product development culture — one where "move fast and break things" is replaced by "move deliberately and break nothing." Where the cost of a bug is not a support ticket but a regulatory penalty. Where launching in a new country is not a localization exercise but a legal, financial, and operational infrastructure project.

And yet, EOR/COR companies are still technology companies. They compete on platform experience, time-to-hire, self-service capabilities, and integration ecosystems. They need product managers who understand both the regulatory constraints and the competitive urgency. They need analytics leaders who can measure product-market fit, feature adoption, and expansion signals in a domain where the standard SaaS playbook only partially applies.

This module will teach you:

- What the product landscape looks like in EOR/COR and what each product line does
- How product development works when every feature must be compliance-first
- What product-market fit signals look like in B2B payroll and how to measure them
- How PMs prioritize across countries and features in a multi-country platform
- What product analytics infrastructure looks like for EOR platforms
- How to treat client onboarding as a product problem, not just an ops problem
- How pricing and packaging decisions are informed by data
- What product-led growth means in B2B payroll and how to measure expansion
- How platform and API strategy creates competitive moats
- How an analytics leader should partner with product managers day-to-day

**Why this module exists for you specifically:** As an analytics leader, product managers will be among your most demanding internal customers. They need data to prioritize, data to measure, data to justify investment. If you cannot speak their language and anticipate their needs, you will be a report-generating function. If you can, you become a strategic partner who shapes the product roadmap. This module teaches you how to be the latter.
