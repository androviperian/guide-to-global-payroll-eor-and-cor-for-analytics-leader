## Module Summary

Master Data Management (MDM) is the operational discipline that ensures every system in a global EOR platform agrees on a single, authoritative version of critical business entities: workers, clients, legal entities, pay components, tax jurisdictions, and reference codes. Module 7 (Data Platform, Canonical Data Model) gave you the architecture for ingesting, transforming, and serving payroll data across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. This module goes deeper into the upstream problem that Module 7 assumes has been solved: **how do you create, maintain, and govern the master records that every downstream system, analytics pipeline, and compliance report depends on?** Without disciplined MDM, your canonical data model inherits the inconsistencies of its source systems. Your Silver-layer worker entity cannot be trusted if the same worker exists as three different records in three different systems, each with a slightly different name, a different tax ID format, and conflicting employment dates.

In a global EOR operation, MDM is not an abstract data-engineering exercise. It is an operational necessity with direct financial and compliance consequences. A duplicate worker record can cause double payment. A mislinked client hierarchy can route revenue to the wrong legal entity. A stale tax rate in the reference data store can cause systematic filing errors across every worker in a jurisdiction. The EOR model amplifies these risks because the platform is the employer of record, meaning every data error is the company's legal liability, not the client's. Module 2 (Worker Lifecycle) described the lifecycle stages that generate master data. Module 5 (Compliance) described the regulations that constrain how master data must be structured, retained, and protected. Module 10 (Security/Audit) described the access controls and audit trails that govern who can change master data. This module ties all of those threads together into the operational practice of MDM.

This module covers ten topics spanning MDM fundamentals, entity resolution algorithms, the core data domains (worker, client, organization, reference data), data quality frameworks, governance structures, technology platforms, cross-border complexity, and the analytics leader's role in building MDM as a strategic capability. By the end, you will understand not just what master data is, but how to build the processes, controls, and metrics that keep it trustworthy at scale across dozens of countries and hundreds of thousands of worker records.
