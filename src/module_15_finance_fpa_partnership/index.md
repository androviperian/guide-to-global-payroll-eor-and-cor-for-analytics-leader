## Module Summary

If Module 1 taught you how the EOR machine works, this module teaches you how it *makes money* — and how the analytics team becomes the CFO's most trusted partner in understanding, forecasting, and optimizing that money-making machine.

Here is the truth about working in analytics at an EOR company: the Finance team is either your most powerful ally or your most frustrated stakeholder. There is no middle ground. The CFO needs analytics to answer questions that no one else in the company can answer: Why did gross margin drop 180 basis points this quarter? Which countries are underwater and should we exit? If we add 2,000 workers next quarter, what does our cash position look like? Are we billing every single worker correctly, or is revenue leaking through cracks in the invoicing pipeline?

These are not dashboards-and-charts questions. They are questions that determine whether the company raises its next round, hits its board targets, or survives a cash crunch caused by prefunding payroll in 40 countries simultaneously. The analytics leader who can answer these questions fluently — who speaks the language of contribution margin, DSO, ARR cohorts, and ASC 606 with the same confidence they speak about data pipelines — becomes indispensable.

This module builds your complete understanding of the Finance-Analytics partnership in global payroll and EOR operations. By the end, you will understand:

- How EOR companies actually make money — the full revenue stack beyond PEPM, including FX markup, float income, and value-added services
- How to forecast revenue when your drivers include worker additions, churn, pricing changes, country mix shifts, and FX movements — all simultaneously
- Unit economics at the country level, including when a country is profitable, when it is not, and when to exit
- The FP&A operating cadence — monthly close, quarterly forecast, annual plan — and how analytics plugs into each phase
- Billing analytics and revenue assurance: how to detect leakage, ensure invoice accuracy, and comply with ASC 606
- The EOR cost stack and where optimization levers exist
- Cash flow analytics that matter to the CFO: working capital, prefunding exposure, DSO, and FX hedging
- What investors and board members actually care about and how to build reporting that satisfies them
- Financial controls, SOX readiness, and how analytics supports IPO-track governance
- How to build and sustain the Finance-Analytics partnership as a structural advantage

**This module sits at the intersection of finance fluency and data engineering.** If you cannot explain contribution margin by country to the CFO and also explain how the data warehouse computes it to your engineering team, you are only doing half the job. Start here to do both.
