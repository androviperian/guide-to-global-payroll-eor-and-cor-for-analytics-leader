## Module Summary

Here is the uncomfortable truth about EOR and COR operations: **you do not control most of the machinery that determines whether your customers' workers get paid correctly.** In-country payroll processors calculate the gross-to-net. Tax engine providers supply the withholding rates. Banks move the money. Benefits brokers enroll workers in health insurance. Immigration agencies process work permits. Legal counsel advises on termination risk. And if any of them fail -- if a local payroll processor in the Philippines applies the wrong tax table, if a bank in Nigeria delays a payment rail, if an immigration agency in Germany misses a work permit renewal deadline -- your platform takes the blame. Your SLA is broken. Your client is angry. Your worker is unpaid or non-compliant.

This is the fundamental paradox of EOR at scale: **your service quality is defined by partners you don't employ, using systems you don't own, following processes you can only influence.** Managing this partner ecosystem is not a procurement function. It is an operational discipline as critical as payroll processing itself.

This module teaches you how to build, measure, and optimize the partner and vendor ecosystem that an EOR/COR platform depends on. By the end of this module, you will understand:

- The full taxonomy of partners in the EOR ecosystem and how each affects service delivery
- How to manage the partner lifecycle from discovery through exit, including the critical due diligence process for new-country launches
- How in-country payroll processors, tax engines, banking partners, benefits brokers, immigration agencies, and legal counsel each require distinct management approaches
- How to build quantitative partner scorecards with automated data collection, benchmarking, and quarterly business reviews
- How to identify and mitigate partner concentration risk, single points of failure, and partner financial health issues
- How to build a partner analytics function with dashboards, predictive models, and cost optimization

**Why this is hard at the analytics leader level:** Partner management sits at the intersection of operations, procurement, finance, and compliance. No single team owns it cleanly. The analytics leader must build cross-functional visibility into partner performance, cost, and risk -- often against resistance from teams that have managed partner relationships informally for years. You are bringing data discipline to relationships that have historically been managed on trust and email.

**Maturity trajectory:**
- **500 workers:** You have 15-25 partners across 10-15 countries. You manage them with spreadsheets and monthly emails. When something breaks, you find out because a worker complains.
- **5,000 workers:** You have 60-100 partners across 40-60 countries. You have basic SLAs and quarterly reviews. A partner operations team exists but is overwhelmed.
- **50,000 workers:** You have 150-300+ partners across 80-150 countries. Automated scorecards, real-time monitoring, predictive risk models, and a dedicated partner analytics function are not optional -- they are survival requirements.
