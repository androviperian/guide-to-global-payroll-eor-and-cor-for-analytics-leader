## Module Summary

Market sizing is where strategy meets data operations. Every board deck, fundraising pitch, geographic expansion decision, and sales territory plan depends on a defensible answer to: "How big is our market, and how much of it can we actually capture?" In the EOR/COR industry, this question is especially complex because the market is fragmented across 190+ countries, evolving rapidly, and served by competitors ranging from bootstrapped startups to publicly traded giants.

This module goes far beyond textbook TAM/SAM/SOM definitions. It covers the **operational pipeline** of how companies actually build their addressable market data — from purchasing raw B2B data from vendors like **ZoomInfo** and **D&B (Dun & Bradstreet)**, through entity resolution and golden record construction, ICP filtering, and ultimately handing enriched, qualified leads to the sales team. This is the bridge between marketing strategy and sales execution, and it is deeply data-intensive.

This module connects to:

- **Module 17 (Sales Analytics & GTM)** — pipeline generation, win rates, sales productivity metrics that depend on market data quality
- **Module 19 (Marketing Analytics)** — demand generation, lead scoring, attribution models that consume TAM-derived audiences
- **Module 23 (Country Launch Playbook)** — geographic market analysis that drives country prioritization and expansion sequencing
- **Module 21 (Competitive Intelligence)** — competitor market share estimation, positioning analysis, win/loss patterns
- **Module 8 (MDM)** — golden record construction, entity resolution, and data quality principles applied to market data

**Why this matters for your role:** The analytics leader who can build and maintain a defensible market sizing capability — connecting third-party data vendors, CRM systems, and internal operational data into a unified market intelligence platform — becomes the person who drives strategic decisions, not just reports on them. You are the one who tells the CEO which countries to enter, which segments to pursue, and how much pipeline the sales team should be generating.
