## Module Summary

If you are joining a company like Multiplier, Deel, Papaya Global, or Rippling, the first thing you need to understand is: **what does this company actually do, mechanically, every single month?**

The short answer: it makes sure that workers in dozens of countries get paid correctly and on time, while keeping their client companies legally compliant in jurisdictions they may never have set foot in. That is a deceptively simple sentence that hides enormous operational complexity.

This module builds your foundational understanding of the three core operating models in this industry — **Global Payroll**, **Employer of Record (EOR)**, and **Contractor of Record (COR)** — and the operational machinery that makes them work. By the end of this module, you will understand:

- What EOR and COR actually mean, how they differ, and why companies choose one over the other
- How the company makes money — the full revenue stack including PEPM fees, FX markup, and payment float
- The end-to-end hire-to-net-pay process with real numbers for India and the UK
- What the internal org of an EOR company looks like and who your stakeholders are
- How payroll calendars, system landscapes, and controls work together to produce accurate pay
- What "good" looks like when measured by KPIs, and where AI can realistically help

**This is the foundation everything else in this book builds on.** If you don't understand the operating model, the compliance chapters, the finance chapters, and the AI chapters will feel abstract. Start here.
