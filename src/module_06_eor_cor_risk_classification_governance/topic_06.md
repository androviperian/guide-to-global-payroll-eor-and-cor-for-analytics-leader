# Topic 6: Governance Operating Model — Board, Risk Committee, Policy Framework, Three Lines of Defense

## What It Is

Governance in the EOR/COR context is the organizational structure, policies, processes, and forums that ensure risk decisions are made consistently, documented thoroughly, and reviewed regularly. It is not a single document or a quarterly meeting — it is an operating model that runs continuously alongside the business.

The standard framework for risk governance is the **Three Lines of Defense** model, adapted from financial services:

- **First line — Operations:** The teams that run payroll, manage contractors, process invoices, and interact with clients and workers daily. They own the risk at the point of origin.
- **Second line — Risk and Compliance:** The teams that set policies, define risk frameworks, monitor compliance, and provide independent oversight of the first line. They design the controls and verify they work.
- **Third line — Internal Audit:** Independent assurance that both the first and second lines are functioning as intended. Reports to the board audit committee, not to management.

## Why It Matters

- **Regulatory expectation:** Tax authorities, labor inspectors, and data protection regulators increasingly expect documented governance frameworks. "We didn't know" is not a defense; "we had a process and followed it" is.
- **Legal defensibility:** When a misclassification claim arises 3 years after the fact, the governance framework provides evidence of: the decision process, the rationale, the reviewers, and the escalation path. This is the difference between "reasonable care" and "negligence."
- **Board and investor confidence:** Boards of EOR companies are personally liable for certain employment and tax obligations in some jurisdictions. A governance framework is how they demonstrate oversight.
- **Operational consistency:** Without governance, the same classification question gets answered differently by different analysts, in different countries, on different days. Governance creates consistency through policy, review forums, and decision logs.
- **Scale enablement:** At 500 workers, you can manage risk through personal relationships and ad hoc reviews. At 50,000 workers across 80 countries, you need a system. Governance is the system.

|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Classification** | Manual legal review per case | Scoring model with legal review for high-risk | Automated scoring with ML, legal review for critical only |
| **Governance forums** | Monthly all-hands risk discussion | Weekly risk committee + quarterly board review | Full three lines of defense with 5 governance forums |
| **Policy framework** | Basic classification policy | Full policy hierarchy (4 levels) | Regulatory-grade policy framework with version control |
| **Decision log** | Spreadsheet | Structured database | Auditable system with search, reporting, and retention |
| **Reporting** | Ad hoc PowerPoint for board | Monthly risk dashboard | Real-time risk dashboard with board self-service access |
| **Internal audit** | External auditor annually | Dedicated internal audit function | Continuous audit program with automated control testing |
| **Risk appetite** | Implicit ("we're careful") | Documented risk appetite statement | Quantified risk appetite with tolerance thresholds per risk category |
| **Technology** | Spreadsheets + email | Purpose-built risk management module | Integrated GRC platform with automated workflows and alerts |
| **Staff** | Compliance is part-time for 1 person | 3-5 person compliance team | 15-25+ person risk and compliance function |

## The decision log

Every material risk decision must be logged for defensibility:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Decision ID** | Unique identifier | DL-2026-0142 |
| **Date** | When the decision was made | 2026-02-15 |
| **Forum** | Which governance forum made the decision | Classification Review Board |
| **Country** | Affected country/countries | Germany |
| **Subject** | Brief description | Contractor classification risk for senior software engineer engaged by TechCorp |
| **Risk score** | Model-generated risk score | 87 (Critical) |
| **Options considered** | What alternatives were discussed | 1. Convert to EOR; 2. Restructure engagement (reduce hours, add second client); 3. End engagement |
| **Decision** | What was decided | Convert to EOR. Client notified. 30-day conversion timeline. |
| **Rationale** | Why this option was chosen | Score of 87 exceeds risk appetite. Worker meets 7/8 employee indicators. Germany's Scheinselbstandigkeit risk is severe (criminal liability). Legal counsel concurs. |
| **Dissenting views** | If anyone disagreed | Client Success noted TechCorp may churn. Risk Committee determined risk outweighs retention. |
| **Legal review** | Whether legal counsel was involved | Yes. External German counsel reviewed and confirmed recommendation. |
| **Review date** | When the decision should be revisited | N/A (conversion to be completed by 2026-03-15) |

## Data Artifacts

| Entity | Key Fields | Analytics Enabled |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Decision log | decision_id, date, forum, country, subject, risk_score, options[], decision, rationale, dissent, legal_review_flag, review_date | Decision pattern analysis, precedent search, governance compliance tracking |
| Policy register | policy_id, title, version, owner, approval_date, approving_forum, next_review_date, status | Policy currency monitoring, gap analysis |
| Governance forum minutes | forum_id, meeting_date, attendees[], agenda_items[], decisions[], action_items[], next_meeting_date | Attendance tracking, action item follow-through, decision audit trail |
| Control register | control_id, control_name, control_type (preventive/detective/corrective), owner, testing_frequency, last_test_date, test_result, remediation_status | Control effectiveness tracking, gap identification |
| Risk appetite metrics | risk_category, metric_name, appetite_threshold, tolerance_threshold, current_value, status (within/approaching/breached) | Risk appetite monitoring, board reporting |

## Controls

- **Forum quorum requirements:** Each governance forum has a defined quorum — decisions made without quorum are invalid and must be re-ratified
- **Decision log completeness:** System enforces all required fields before a decision log entry can be finalized; incomplete entries generate compliance alerts
- **Policy review calendar:** Every policy has a defined review cycle (annual or biannual); automated alerts 60 days before review is due
- **Action item tracking:** Every action item from a governance forum is tracked with an owner, due date, and status; overdue items are escalated to the next forum
- **Board reporting package review:** The risk report to the board is reviewed by the CCO, CLO, and CFO before distribution; errors in board-level risk reporting are treated as material incidents
- **Segregation of duties in governance:** The team that assesses risk (first line) is not the same team that sets risk policy (second line) or audits the process (third line)

## Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target | Frequency | Owner |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Governance forum attendance** | Average attendance rate across all governance forums | > 90% | Monthly | Compliance Director |
| **Decision log completeness** | % of material risk decisions with complete decision log entries | 100% | Monthly | Compliance Director |
| **Policy currency** | % of policies reviewed within their defined review cycle | 100% | Quarterly | Compliance Director |
| **Action item completion rate** | % of governance forum action items completed by due date | > 85% | Monthly | Compliance Director |
| **Control testing coverage** | % of defined controls tested within the last 12 months | 100% | Quarterly | Internal Audit |
| **Control effectiveness** | % of tested controls found to be operating effectively | > 95% | Quarterly | Internal Audit |
| **Risk appetite breaches** | Number of risk categories where current value exceeds tolerance threshold | 0 | Monthly | Risk Committee |
| **Time to incident escalation** | Median hours from incident detection to risk committee notification | < 24 hours | Per incident | Compliance Director |
| **Board risk report timeliness** | % of quarterly board risk reports delivered on time | 100% | Quarterly | CCO |
| **Training completion (compliance)** | % of first-line staff who completed required compliance training in the last 12 months | > 95% | Quarterly | Compliance Director |
| **Regulatory change response** | Median days from regulatory change publication to policy/procedure update | < 30 days | Per event | Legal/Compliance |
| **Internal audit finding closure** | % of internal audit findings remediated within agreed timeline | > 90% | Quarterly | Internal Audit |

## Common Failure Modes

- **Governance theater.** Forums meet, minutes are taken, but nothing changes. The risk committee discusses the same issues quarter after quarter without resolution. Action items are assigned but never tracked. The governance framework exists on paper but not in practice.
- **First line and second line collapse.** The same team that processes contractor classifications also writes the classification policy and monitors compliance with it. There is no independent oversight. When the team makes a systematic error, nobody catches it because there is no second line.
- **Decision log not maintained.** A critical classification decision is made via email between the compliance lead and a lawyer. There is no log entry. Two years later, when the regulator asks how the decision was made, nobody can reconstruct the rationale.
- **Risk appetite not quantified.** The board says "we have low risk appetite for misclassification." But what does "low" mean? Is 5% of contractors at high risk acceptable? 2%? Without quantification, the risk appetite statement is meaningless.
- **Internal audit skipped at growth stage.** The company has 5,000 workers across 40 countries but no internal audit function. The board relies on management to self-report risk issues. This works until it doesn't — and when it fails, it fails catastrophically.
- **Governance not adapted to scale.** The startup-era "monthly risk chat" is still the governance model at 20,000 workers. There is no classification review board, no partner governance council, and no decision log. The company has outgrown its governance framework but nobody has rebuilt it.

## AI Opportunities

- **Governance compliance monitor:** Input: forum schedules, attendance records, minutes, action items, decision logs. Output: governance health dashboard showing forum attendance trends, overdue action items, incomplete decision logs, upcoming policy reviews. Guardrails: must not generate content for governance outputs (minutes, decisions) — only track and monitor; must not substitute for human governance decisions.
- **Policy gap detector:** Input: regulatory database, current policy register, enforcement actions in relevant jurisdictions. Output: identification of regulatory areas not covered by existing policies, with priority ranking based on enforcement risk. Guardrails: must flag gaps for legal/compliance review, not auto-generate policies; must distinguish between proposed regulations (lower urgency) and enacted regulations (higher urgency).
- **Decision log search and precedent matching:** Input: new classification case details. Output: similar historical decisions from the decision log, with relevance score, to support consistent decision-making. Guardrails: must present precedents as reference, not as binding; must flag when the new case has materially different facts than the precedent; must respect access controls on decision log entries.

## Discovery Questions

1. "What does our governance structure look like today? Do we have a three lines of defense model, or is compliance embedded within operations?"
2. "How are classification decisions documented? Is there a decision log, and if so, is it consistently maintained?"
3. "Does the board receive a regular risk report? What metrics does it include, and how is the portfolio-level risk exposure calculated?"
4. "When was our classification policy last reviewed and updated? Is there a defined review cycle?"
5. "Do we have an internal audit function, or do we rely on external audit? If external, what is the scope and frequency?"

## Exercises

1. **Design a governance operating model.** For a company with 10,000 EOR/COR workers across 50 countries, define: the three lines of defense (specific roles and responsibilities), 5 governance forums (participants, frequency, agenda, outputs), and the policy framework hierarchy. Present as a 2-page governance charter.
2. **Create 5 decision log entries.** For these scenarios: (a) borderline contractor in Australia, score 58; (b) critical-risk developer in Germany, score 91; (c) new partner approval for Nigeria; (d) policy change to require legal review for all scores above 60; (e) acceptance of PE risk for a specific client with 3 workers in Singapore. For each, complete all fields including rationale and dissenting views.
3. **Analytics-leader exercise: Build a governance health dashboard.** Design a dashboard with 8 metrics tracking governance effectiveness: forum attendance, action item completion, decision log completeness, policy currency, control testing coverage, risk appetite status, incident response time, and audit finding closure rate. For each, specify: data source, visualization type, threshold for red/yellow/green status, and the action triggered when a metric goes red.
