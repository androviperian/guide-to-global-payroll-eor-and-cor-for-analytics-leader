# Module 6: EOR/COR Risk, Worker Classification, and Governance

> **Disclaimer:** This module is operational guidance for learning purposes. It is not legal advice. Worker classification, co-employment, permanent establishment, and indemnification determinations require qualified legal counsel in each jurisdiction.

## Module Summary

Module 1 introduced EOR and COR as operating models — what they do, how they make money, how payroll flows from gross to net. This module takes you into the **risk engine** underneath those models: the legal, financial, and operational risks that EOR and COR create, and the governance structures that keep them from becoming existential threats to the business.

If the operating model is the car, this module is the braking system, the crash-test rating, and the insurance policy. You can drive without understanding brakes — until you need to stop.

Here is what makes this module critical for an analytics leader:

- **Classification risk is the single largest contingent liability** on any EOR/COR company's books. A misclassification ruling in a major market can generate eight-figure penalties, retroactive tax obligations, and mandatory benefit claims going back years. You need to understand how to quantify, score, and monitor this risk.
- **Governance is what separates a compliant operation from a lawsuit waiting to happen.** The difference between "we thought it was fine" and "we have a documented, board-reviewed decision log that demonstrates our process" is the difference between a defensible position and a negligence finding.
- **Risk analytics is an emerging discipline** in this industry. Most EOR companies still manage classification risk with spreadsheets and quarterly legal reviews. Building a real-time, ML-augmented risk scoring engine is a genuine competitive advantage — and exactly the kind of thing an analytics leader should be proposing.

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How worker classification works in the US, UK, Germany, India, Australia, and Brazil — and why the tests differ in ways that matter operationally
- The specific legal mechanisms of EOR and COR models, including the tripartite employment relationship and its failure modes
- How to build a quantitative risk scoring framework with specific features, weights, and decision thresholds
- The three lines of defense governance model applied to EOR/COR operations
- What real misclassification enforcement actions look like — Uber, FedEx, and gig economy rulings — with dollar amounts and outcomes
- How to build a risk analytics function from scratch, including dashboards, predictive models, and governance metrics

**This is the module that separates someone who understands payroll operations from someone who understands the payroll business.** If you are interviewing at Multiplier, Deel, Papaya Global, or similar companies, the topics here — classification risk, co-employment, governance — are what the C-suite thinks about constantly.
