## Module Summary

Modules 1 through 6 taught you the operational domain — how workers get hired, paid, filed for, and terminated across dozens of countries. This module is where **your BI and lakehouse expertise becomes the connective tissue** that turns all of that operational knowledge into a unified, trustworthy data platform.

The central challenge: payroll data is generated by dozens of systems, in dozens of countries, in dozens of formats, with different schemas, different update frequencies, and different quality levels. A worker named "Priya Sharma" in the platform might be "SHARMA, PRIYA" in the Indian payroll engine and "P. Sharma" in the benefits system. A "payroll run" in Germany contains church tax and solidarity surcharge fields that simply do not exist in Singapore. A "termination" in Brazil triggers FGTS penalty calculations with no equivalent anywhere else. And every single one of these data points must be correct, auditable, and available for analytics — because this data directly determines whether people get paid the right amount on the right day.

**Why payroll data is harder than typical SaaS data:**

- **Correctness is non-negotiable.** A 0.1% error rate in e-commerce recommendations is invisible. A 0.1% error rate in payroll means hundreds of people received the wrong pay.
- **Schema diversity is structural, not cosmetic.** India's CTC breakdown (Basic + HRA + Special Allowance) and the UK's single gross salary are fundamentally different data structures representing the same concept.
- **Temporal precision matters.** "What was this worker's salary on March 15?" is not a nice-to-have question — it determines whether a payroll run was calculated correctly.
- **Multi-currency is unavoidable.** Every monetary amount exists in at least two currencies (local and reporting currency), and the exchange rate used matters for reconciliation.
- **Regulatory audit trails are mandatory.** You cannot delete data that a tax authority might request. Retention periods vary by country — 7 years in Germany, 10 years in France, 8 years in India.
- **PII density is extreme.** Every record contains names, tax IDs, bank accounts, salaries, and addresses — the most sensitive categories of personal data.

By the end of this module, you will understand how to architect a data platform that handles all of this complexity, model every core entity with production-grade schemas, build an event spine that captures every operational moment, and deliver analytics that your ops, finance, compliance, and executive stakeholders can trust.
