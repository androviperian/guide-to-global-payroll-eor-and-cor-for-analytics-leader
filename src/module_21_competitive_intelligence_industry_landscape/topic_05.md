# Topic 5: Pricing and Business Model Analysis

## What It Is

A systematic analysis of how competitors price their EOR/COR services, the business model structures behind those prices, and how pricing strategy affects market positioning, win rates, and margins. This covers PEPM fee structures, FX markup strategies, bundled vs. unbundled models, transparent vs. opaque pricing, volume discounts, and how pricing varies by country, client segment, and competitive pressure.

## Why It Matters

Pricing is the single most common factor in competitive deal losses in the EOR market. Yet most companies have only anecdotal knowledge of competitor pricing — fragments from deal negotiations and outdated website screenshots. A rigorous pricing intelligence capability enables better pricing decisions, more effective sales negotiations, and clearer understanding of how much margin the company can capture vs. must sacrifice for growth.

## Total Cost of Employment (TCE) — The Hidden Pricing Battle

The PEPM fee is only part of what a client pays. Total cost of employment includes:

```
TOTAL COST OF EMPLOYMENT (TCE) PER WORKER

┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Gross Salary                         │  Set by client
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. Employer Statutory Costs             │  Country-dependent (15-45% of gross)
│     (Social security, pension, insurance)│
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. EOR Service Fee (PEPM)               │  $300-$700/month (the quoted price)
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  4. FX Markup                            │  0.5-3% of total salary flow
│     (Hidden in exchange rate)            │  Often $50-$200/worker/month
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  5. Supplementary Benefits Markup        │  5-15% markup on benefits premiums
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  6. Deposit/Float Opportunity Cost       │  1-2 months deposit; client loses
│                                          │  interest income
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  7. Amendment/Off-cycle Fees             │  $50-$200 per occurrence
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

EXAMPLE: Worker in Germany, €85,000/year salary

               Competitor A    Competitor B    Competitor C
               (Low PEPM)      (Mid PEPM)      (High PEPM)
Gross salary:  €85,000         €85,000         €85,000
Employer costs:€17,850 (21%)   €17,850 (21%)   €17,850 (21%)
PEPM fee:      €399 × 12=€4,788  €549 × 12=€6,588  €699 × 12=€8,388
FX markup:     2% = €2,057     0.5% = €514     1% = €1,029
Benefits markup: 10% = €500    5% = €250       8% = €400
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total TCE:     €110,195        €110,202        €112,667
Effective diff:  Nearly equal     Nearly equal    +2.2%

KEY INSIGHT: Competitor A's low PEPM is offset by higher FX markup.
             The "cheapest" headline price may not be the cheapest TCE.

## Pricing Strategy Archetypes

| Strategy | Description | Used By | Best For |
|----------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Transparent flat-rate** | Published PEPM, same for all countries | Remote, Oyster | SMB/mid-market; builds trust; limits negotiation |
| **Country-tiered** | Different PEPM by country complexity | Deel, Multiplier | Better unit economics; complex to communicate |
| **Salary-percentage** | PEPM as % of gross salary (often 10-15%) | Some legacy providers | Aligns with risk (higher salary = more liability) |
| **Platform-bundled** | EOR included in broader HR platform price | Rippling | Cross-sell value; hard to compare apples-to-apples |
| **Enterprise custom** | All pricing negotiated; no published rates | G-P, Papaya, Safeguard | Enterprise deals; maximizes per-deal pricing |
| **Freemium + upsell** | Free contractor management; paid EOR | Several startups | Land-and-expand strategy |

## How Pricing Affects Win Rates — Multi-Region View

| Region | Price Sensitivity | Key Pricing Factors | Competitive Dynamic |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **US clients hiring in APAC** | Medium-High | FX transparency matters; India/Philippines pricing is very competitive | Deel and Multiplier compete aggressively on APAC PEPM |
| **US clients hiring in EU** | Medium | Compliance value justifies premium; TCE focus | Remote and G-P compete on compliance depth |
| **EU clients (GDPR-conscious)** | Medium | Data residency costs can increase TCE; EU-headquartered providers preferred | Remote, Oyster benefit from EU headquarters |
| **APAC-originated clients** | High | Price is often the primary decision factor | Multiplier, local providers have cost advantage |
| **Enterprise (500+ workers)** | Low-Medium | Total value of partnership matters more than PEPM | G-P, Papaya, Deel compete on capability + scale |
| **SMB (<20 workers)** | Very High | Published pricing drives initial consideration set | Deel, Remote, Oyster compete on website pricing |

## Data Artifacts

| Artifact | Key Fields | System of Record |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Competitor pricing database | competitor_id, country, service_type, pepm_amount, currency, fx_markup_pct, effective_date, source, confidence | CI platform |
| TCE calculator | country, competitor, gross_salary, employer_costs, pepm, fx_markup, benefits_markup, total_tce | Analytics tool |
| Deal pricing intelligence | deal_id, competitor, competitor_quoted_price, our_price, country, outcome, price_delta | CRM + CI |
| Pricing change tracker | competitor_id, change_date, old_price, new_price, change_type, affected_countries, source | CI platform |
| Win rate by price delta | price_delta_bucket, deal_count, win_count, win_rate, avg_deal_size | CRM analytics |

## Controls

| Control | Type | Frequency | Owner |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| Competitor website pricing scrape | Semi-automated | Weekly | CI Analyst |
| Deal-level competitor pricing validation | Manual | Per deal (win/loss debrief) | Sales Ops |
| TCE model accuracy review | Manual | Quarterly | Finance + CI |
| FX markup estimation validation | Manual | Quarterly | Treasury + CI |
| Pricing intelligence distribution review | Manual | Quarterly | Sales Enablement |

## Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Pricing data coverage | % of competitor × country combinations with pricing data | >60% of active markets | <40% |
| Pricing data freshness | Avg age of pricing data points in database | <90 days | >180 days |
| Win rate at price parity (±5%) | Win rate when our price is within 5% of competitor | >55% | <45% |
| Win rate at price premium (>10% higher) | Win rate when we are significantly more expensive | >35% | <25% |
| Price-driven loss rate | % of losses where price was cited as primary/secondary reason | <30% | >40% |
| Avg discount to list price | Average negotiated discount across all deals | 10-15% | >25% (pricing credibility risk) |
| FX margin captured | Actual FX margin realized vs target | ≥target | <80% of target |
| TCE competitiveness score | % of country/segment combinations where our TCE is within 10% of cheapest | >70% | <50% |
| Pricing page conversion rate | % of website visitors who request pricing | Track vs competitors | Declining trend |
| PEPM by country accuracy | How accurately our PEPM covers actual costs + target margin by country | All countries positive margin | Any country with negative margin unintentionally |

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Consequence | Prevention |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Comparing PEPM without FX markup | Thinking you are cheaper when you are actually more expensive (or vice versa) | Always calculate and compare TCE, not just PEPM |
| Stale competitor pricing data | Losing deals based on incorrect price comparisons | Weekly website monitoring; deal-level validation |
| One-size-fits-all pricing defense | Using the same price justification for SMB and enterprise buyers | Segment pricing messaging and battlecards |
| Racing to the bottom on price | Destroying margins without building alternative differentiation | Track win rate vs price delta to find the optimal pricing band |
| Ignoring indirect pricing signals | Missing pricing changes from competitors until deals are lost | Monitor job postings (pricing analysts), press releases, G2 reviews |

## AI Opportunities

| Opportunity | Approach | Impact |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Dynamic pricing recommendation | ML model that recommends optimal pricing per deal based on competitor, segment, country, and historical win rates | Very High — direct revenue impact |
| TCE auto-calculation | Automated total cost calculator that factors in all components for any country × competitor combination | High — enables apples-to-apples comparisons |
| Price sensitivity prediction | Classifier that predicts how price-sensitive a prospect is based on firmographic and behavioral signals | High — better discount strategy |
| Competitor pricing change detection | Web monitoring + NLP to detect pricing page changes and new pricing mentions | Medium — real-time pricing intelligence |

## Discovery Questions

1. "How do you think about pricing intelligence when most EOR providers do not publish their prices?"
2. "Describe how you would build a total cost of employment model that accounts for PEPM, FX markup, and hidden costs."
3. "When your win/loss data shows that pricing is the most cited reason for losses, how do you determine whether the issue is actual pricing vs. perceived value?"
4. "How would you measure the revenue impact of a 10% price reduction in your top 5 countries?"
5. "What data would you need to prove to the CFO that raising prices in certain segments would not materially hurt win rates?"

## Exercises

1. **TCE comparison exercise:** For a hypothetical worker earning $80,000/year in the UK, build a total cost of employment comparison across three competitors. Include: gross salary, employer NICs, PEPM, estimated FX markup, and benefits markup. Which competitor is actually cheapest? Does this change for a worker in India at $30,000/year?
2. **Pricing strategy recommendation:** Your company currently uses flat-rate PEPM pricing across all countries. Build a business case for or against switching to country-tiered pricing. Include: expected impact on revenue, win rates, sales complexity, and competitive positioning.
3. **Win rate analysis:** Design a SQL query (pseudocode acceptable) that would calculate win rates segmented by: price premium/discount bucket, country, and client segment. What would you do with the results?
