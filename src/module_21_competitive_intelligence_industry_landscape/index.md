## Module Summary

Every industry has companies that win and companies that struggle. In the global EOR/COR/payroll space, the difference between winners and losers increasingly comes down to **who understands the competitive landscape most deeply and acts on that understanding fastest.** This module builds your capability to be the person who provides that understanding.

As an analytics leader in this industry, you are not just building dashboards for internal operations. You are building an intelligence function that tells leadership: where competitors are investing, what clients are choosing and why, which market segments are being underserved, and where the industry is heading. This is competitive intelligence (CI) treated as an analytics discipline, not a sales support function.

This module covers:

- **Market sizing and segmentation** — how big the EOR/COR market actually is, where the growth is, and what drives it
- **Competitor deep dives** — detailed profiles of the 10 major players with funding, strategy, strengths, and weaknesses
- **Competitive positioning** — how to build defensible advantages and position against specific competitors in deals
- **Technology and product comparison** — feature-by-feature analysis of what competitors offer and where gaps exist
- **Pricing analysis** — how pricing works across the industry and how it affects win rates
- **M&A and consolidation** — who is buying whom, why, and what it means for the market
- **Win/loss intelligence** — building systematic processes to learn from every deal won and lost
- **Market trends and disruption** — AI, regulation, and structural shifts reshaping the industry
- **Competitive monitoring** — building always-on dashboards that track competitor signals
- **Building a CI function** — how to operationalize competitive intelligence as an analytics capability

**Why this matters for your role:** The analytics leader who can connect internal operational data with external market intelligence becomes the most strategically valuable person in the room. You stop being the person who reports what happened and become the person who explains what it means in the context of the competitive environment.
