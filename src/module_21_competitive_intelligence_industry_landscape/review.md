# Module 21 Review

## Quiz — 10 Questions

**Instructions:** Answer each question, then check against the expected answers below. These questions test both factual recall and applied reasoning about competitive intelligence in the EOR/COR market.

## Questions

**Q1.** Name three structural competitive moats in the EOR industry that are durable (take years to replicate), and explain why each is hard to copy.

**Q2.** What is the difference between PEPM and TCE (Total Cost of Employment), and why is comparing PEPM alone misleading when evaluating competitor pricing?

**Q3.** A competitor has posted 12 machine learning engineer roles and 5 "Payroll Rules Engine Developer" roles in the last 60 days. They also filed a patent for "automated multi-jurisdiction compliance validation." Interpret these signals: what strategic move are they likely making?

**Q4.** Your win/loss data shows a 62% win rate against Competitor A but only 34% against Competitor B. Both have similar market positioning. What analysis would you conduct before concluding that Competitor B is simply a stronger competitor?

**Q5.** What are the three main revenue streams for an EOR company beyond the PEPM service fee?

**Q6.** The EU Platform Workers Directive shifts the burden of proof for worker classification from the worker to the platform/company. How does this specifically affect the COR (Contractor of Record) business model?

**Q7.** Explain the difference between a "thick EOR" (owned entity) and a "thin EOR" (partner entity) strategy. What are the competitive implications of each?

**Q8.** You need to build a competitive intelligence function from scratch. You have budget for one FTE and $50K in tools. What are your first three deliverables in the first 90 days?

**Q9.** A major competitor just acquired a cross-border payments company. What are three ways this acquisition could change the competitive dynamics in the market?

**Q10.** Why might the lowest-PEPM competitor actually be more expensive for a client than a competitor with a higher PEPM fee? Give a specific numerical example.

**Q11.** Name three ethical boundaries in competitive intelligence that should never be crossed, and one "yellow zone" practice that requires careful judgment.

**Q12.** How would you measure whether your competitive battlecards are actually improving sales outcomes, rather than just being distributed?

## Expected Answers

**A1.** Three durable moats: (1) **Owned entity network** — takes years and millions of dollars to establish legal entities in 80+ countries, including regulatory approvals, bank accounts, and local infrastructure. (2) **Proprietary payroll engine** — building gross-to-net calculation software for dozens of countries requires deep domain expertise in local tax and labor law; cannot be built quickly. (3) **Payment infrastructure/regulatory licenses** — obtaining payment licenses in multiple jurisdictions involves lengthy regulatory processes. Each takes years to replicate because they require both significant capital investment and specialized domain knowledge that cannot be shortcut.

**A2.** PEPM (Per Employee Per Month) is just the service fee the EOR charges. TCE includes: gross salary + employer statutory costs + PEPM + FX markup + benefits markup + deposit opportunity cost + amendment fees. Comparing PEPM alone is misleading because a competitor with a low PEPM ($399) might have a high FX markup (2%) and benefits markup (10%), making their actual total cost higher than a competitor charging $599 PEPM with 0.5% FX markup and 5% benefits markup. The client pays TCE, not PEPM.

**A3.** The competitor is investing heavily in AI-powered automated compliance. The ML engineer postings suggest building machine learning models, the payroll rules engine developers suggest automating the gross-to-net calculation or regulatory rule management, and the patent filing confirms this is a strategic technology bet, not just incremental improvement. They are likely building a system that can automatically detect regulatory changes and update payroll rules across jurisdictions, which would reduce operational costs and improve accuracy — a significant competitive advantage within 12-18 months.

**A4.** Before concluding Competitor B is stronger, analyze: (1) **Segment mix** — are you competing against B in different (harder) segments where they have natural advantages? (2) **Price delta** — are deals against B at a different price point or with different pricing dynamics? (3) **Deal size and complexity** — are B deals typically larger/more complex? (4) **Geographic mix** — are you losing to B in specific regions where they have entity/compliance advantages? (5) **Sales rep distribution** — are your strongest reps competing against A and weaker reps against B? (6) **Sample size** — is the 34% statistically significant or based on too few deals? The root cause could be segment mismatch, pricing, or process rather than competitor superiority.

**A5.** Three revenue streams beyond PEPM: (1) **FX markup** — the spread applied to currency conversion when paying workers in local currency (often 30-50% of gross margin). (2) **Payment float** — interest income earned on funds held between client payment and worker pay disbursement. (3) **Amendment and processing fees** — charges for off-cycle payroll runs, contract amendments, expedited onboarding, and termination processing.

**A6.** The EU Platform Workers Directive creates a legal presumption that platform workers are employees unless the company can prove otherwise. For COR businesses, this means: (1) more contractors will need to be reclassified as employees, driving COR-to-EOR conversion demand; (2) the compliance bar for maintaining contractor status becomes much higher, requiring more documentation and assessment; (3) COR providers must invest in more robust classification tools and processes; (4) some contractor arrangements that were previously borderline will no longer be viable, reducing COR revenue but increasing EOR revenue. Net effect: demand shifts from COR to EOR, and COR compliance costs rise significantly.

**A7.** **Thick EOR (owned entity):** The provider has its own legal entity (e.g., GmbH in Germany) and directly employs workers. Advantages: full control over compliance, no margin sharing with partners, faster issue resolution, better data access. Disadvantages: expensive to establish and maintain, slow to scale to new countries. **Thin EOR (partner entity):** The provider contracts with local in-country partners who are the actual legal employers. Advantages: fast scaling to 150+ countries, lower upfront investment. Disadvantages: margin sharing (partner takes 30-50% of PEPM), less control over quality, compliance risk if partner makes errors, dependency on partner relationships. Competitively, owned-entity providers can offer better margins and quality, while partner-heavy providers have broader coverage. The market trend is toward owned entities in high-volume countries and partners only for low-volume or difficult jurisdictions.

**A8.** First 90-day deliverables: (1) **Competitive landscape overview** — comprehensive profiles of top 10 competitors covering funding, positioning, pricing, country coverage, and product features, distributed to sales, product, and exec teams. (2) **Top-3 competitor battlecards** — detailed battlecards for the three competitors most frequently encountered in deals, co-created with sales and immediately deployed. (3) **Win/loss baseline analysis** — analysis of historical CRM data to establish win rate by competitor, loss reason distribution, and segment patterns, providing a data-driven baseline for future CI investment decisions.

**A9.** Three competitive implications of acquiring a payments company: (1) **Lower cost structure** — owning payment rails eliminates banking intermediary fees, enabling either lower prices or higher margins on currency conversion. (2) **Faster settlement** — proprietary payment infrastructure can offer faster worker payments, which is a differentiator in markets where workers are sensitive to pay timing. (3) **New revenue streams** — the competitor can potentially offer payment services beyond payroll (expense reimbursement, contractor payments, business payments), expanding their addressable market and increasing switching costs.

**A10.** A competitor charging $399 PEPM with a 2.5% FX markup is more expensive than one charging $599 PEPM with 0.5% FX markup for high-salary workers. Example: UK worker at GBP 70,000/year. Competitor A (low PEPM): $399/month PEPM + 2.5% FX on ~$89,000 annual flow = $399 + $185/month FX = $584/month effective. Competitor B (high PEPM): $599/month PEPM + 0.5% FX = $599 + $37/month FX = $636/month. But for a German worker at EUR 40,000/year: Competitor A: $399 + $83 = $482/month. Competitor B: $599 + $17 = $616/month. The crossover depends on salary level and currency pair. For high-salary workers in volatile currencies, the FX markup dominates.

**A11.** Three absolute red lines: (1) **Never solicit confidential information from competitor employees** — even if they volunteer it, redirect the conversation. (2) **Never misrepresent your identity** to obtain competitive information (posing as a customer, journalist, etc.). (3) **Never access competitor systems without authorization** — no hacking, social engineering, or unauthorized access of any kind. Yellow zone: **Mystery shopping** (signing up for a competitor demo under a real but non-obvious email) — legal in most jurisdictions but can damage trust and relationships if discovered; proceed with legal guidance and clear business justification.

**A12.** Measurement approach: (1) **Track battlecard access** — instrument battlecards to know which reps viewed them and when relative to deal stages. (2) **Compare win rates** — split deals into "battlecard accessed" vs "not accessed" and compare win rates, controlling for deal size and segment. (3) **A/B testing** — if possible, provide updated battlecards to half the team and measure win rate differential. (4) **Sales rep survey** — ask reps to rate helpfulness (1-5) and provide specific examples of how the battlecard influenced a deal. (5) **Loss reason shifts** — monitor whether losses previously attributed to product/feature gaps decrease after battlecard deployment. The strongest evidence is a statistically significant win rate improvement in deals where the battlecard was used.
