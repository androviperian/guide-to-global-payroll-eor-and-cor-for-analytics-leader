## Module Summary

Module 15 established the partnership between analytics and FP&A — revenue forecasting, unit economics, billing analytics, and investor reporting. This module goes deeper into the financial mechanics that separate a competent analytics leader from an indispensable one: cash flow architecture, deal desk governance, collections management, revenue accounting operations, valuation modeling, and the investor metrics that determine whether your company raises its next round or goes public.

The distinction matters because Module 15 taught you how EOR companies make money and how to forecast that revenue. This module teaches you how cash actually moves through the business (which is different from revenue), how deals get priced and approved before they ever become revenue, what happens when clients do not pay, how the revenue accounting team actually closes the books each month, and how all of this rolls up into the valuation multiples and investor metrics that determine whether the company is worth $500 million or $5 billion. These are the topics that occupy the CFO's mind at 2 AM, and if you can address them with data, you become the analytics leader who gets invited into the boardroom.

This module connects directly to Module 4 (Treasury, Payments, and FX), which covered the mechanics of funding payroll and managing currency risk — here we extend that into full cash flow architecture and conversion cycle analytics. It connects to Module 13 (Client Success and Customer Analytics), where net revenue retention and churn are tracked — here we show how NRR feeds into valuation models and investor narratives. And it connects to Module 17 (Sales Analytics and GTM Operations), where pipeline and deal flow originate — here we follow those deals through the Deal Desk pricing governance process and into AR collections when clients are slow to pay. If Module 15 made you conversant with the CFO, this module makes you conversational with the board, the investors, and the bankers.
