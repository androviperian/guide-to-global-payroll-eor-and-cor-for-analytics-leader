## Module Summary

If Modules 1 through 10 taught you how the EOR/COR machine works operationally, and Modules 11 through 17 taught you how to measure its financial, compliance, and workforce health — this module teaches you where the customers come from, how much they cost to acquire, and how an analytics leader partners with marketing leadership to turn demand generation from gut-driven spending into a measurable, optimizable system.

Here is the blunt reality of EOR/COR marketing: **the companies that win are not the ones with the best payroll engines. They are the ones that appear first when a VP of People at a 200-person startup types "how to hire employees in Germany without an entity" into Google at 11 PM.** That is the moment of intent. Everything in this module builds toward capturing that moment and every moment like it, measuring what happened, and optimizing the spend that makes it possible.

Marketing analytics in this space is uniquely challenging for three reasons:

1. **Long, multi-touch sales cycles.** A typical EOR deal takes 30-90 days from first touch to closed-won. Enterprise deals take 6-12 months. A prospect might read a blog post in January, attend a webinar in March, receive an ABM email in April, and sign a contract in June. Attributing that revenue to any single marketing activity is reductive — but the CMO still needs to know what is working.

2. **Highly fragmented buyer geography.** The same company markets to HR leaders in the US, finance directors in the UK, founders in Singapore, and legal counsel in Germany — each with different content preferences, regulatory constraints on outreach (GDPR), and channel behavior. One-size-fits-all campaigns fail.

3. **Product complexity makes content essential.** Nobody buys EOR services impulsively. The buyer needs to understand employment law nuances, cost structures, compliance risks, and service models. Content marketing is not optional — it is the primary demand engine. This makes content analytics a first-class concern.

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How B2B marketing works specifically in the EOR/COR space and why it is content-led and SEO-heavy
- The full demand generation toolkit: inbound, outbound, ABM, events, referrals
- How to measure marketing with multi-touch attribution in long sales cycles
- Content marketing analytics: what to measure, how to connect content to pipeline
- Paid acquisition economics: CAC by channel, ROAS, keyword strategy for payroll terms
- Website conversion analytics: funnel optimization, landing pages, product-led signup
- Brand and competitive intelligence: share of voice, review platforms, competitor monitoring
- ABM analytics: target account identification, engagement scoring, campaign measurement
- Marketing operations and tech stack: MAP/CRM integration, lead scoring, data quality
- How to build a productive Marketing-Analytics partnership and what CMOs actually need from data teams

**This module makes you the analytics partner that marketing leadership needs — not a dashboard builder, but someone who can tell them where the next dollar of marketing spend should go.**
