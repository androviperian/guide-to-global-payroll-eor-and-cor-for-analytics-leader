## Quiz — 10 Questions

## Questions

**Q1.** An EOR company has 20 AEs with a $1.2M annual quota each, but 5 are in ramp (50% productivity) and 2 are new hires (0% for their first month). What is the effective quota capacity?

**Q2.** Explain why pipeline coverage ratio can be misleading as a health metric. What additional metric should you examine alongside it?

**Q3.** A customer starts with 3 contractors (COR) at $49/month each. Six months later, they convert 3 to EOR at $499/month and add 7 more EOR workers. Calculate: (a) initial monthly revenue, (b) current monthly revenue, (c) expansion multiple.

**Q4.** What is the difference between Net Revenue Retention (NRR) and Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)? Why is NRR typically higher than GRR for a healthy EOR company?

**Q5.** Name three reasons why AE-reported win/loss reasons may differ from buyer-stated reasons. Which is more reliable and why?

**Q6.** What is the "Magic Number" in SaaS sales efficiency? Given $4.5M in sales & marketing spend last quarter and $3.2M in net new ARR this quarter, calculate it and interpret the result.

**Q7.** An EOR company's list PEPM for Germany is $599. The AE offers a 15% discount to win against Deel. The cost to serve one worker in Germany (owned entity) is $210/month. Calculate: (a) discounted PEPM, (b) gross margin per worker at the discounted price, (c) gross margin percentage.

**Q8.** Describe three observable signals that indicate an existing customer is likely to expand within the next 90 days.

**Q9.** Why is it important to track "time to first worker on payroll" separately from "deal closed-won date" in EOR sales analytics?

**Q10.** What is the difference between partner-sourced and partner-influenced attribution? Why does this distinction matter for partner program economics?

**Q11.** A company has beginning ARR of $8M. During the year: $2.4M in expansion, $600K in contraction, $480K in churn from lost logos. Calculate: NRR, GRR, expansion rate, and logo retention rate (assuming 200 customers at start and 16 churned).

**Q12.** Describe the "dashboard factory syndrome" and how to avoid it when building sales analytics capabilities.

**Q13.** Why should EOR pricing analytics account for FX margin separately from PEPM? Give a numerical example.

**Q14.** What is the recommended pipeline coverage ratio for enterprise deals, and why is it different from mid-market?

**Q15.** Explain why a Sales Director of Analytics should attend weekly pipeline reviews rather than just receiving a data export afterward.

## Answers

**A1.** Effective capacity = (13 fully ramped x $1.2M) + (5 in ramp x $1.2M x 0.5) + (2 new hires x $1.2M x 0) = $15.6M + $3.0M + $0 = $18.6M. This is significantly less than the naive calculation of 20 x $1.2M = $24.0M. The $5.4M gap represents the ramp and hiring drag that must be accounted for in revenue planning.

**A2.** Pipeline coverage ratio can be misleading because it treats all pipeline equally. A 4x coverage ratio means nothing if 60% of the pipeline is stale (no activity in 30+ days), mis-staged, or past its close date. You should examine alongside it: pipeline aging (% of pipeline older than 90 days), pipeline activity recency (% of pipeline with recent engagement), and pipeline creation rate (is new pipeline being created fast enough to replace deals that close, die, or age out).

**A3.** (a) Initial monthly revenue: 3 x $49 = $147. (b) Current monthly revenue: 3 x $499 + 7 x $499 = 10 x $499 = $4,990. (c) Expansion multiple: $4,990 / $147 = 33.9x. This dramatic expansion illustrates why the initial deal size in EOR vastly understates customer lifetime value and why land-and-expand metrics are critical.

**A4.** NRR = (Beginning ARR + expansion - contraction - churn) / Beginning ARR. It includes positive expansion revenue. GRR = (Beginning ARR - contraction - churn) / Beginning ARR. It only accounts for negative movements (shrinkage and churn), capped at 100%. NRR is higher than GRR for a healthy EOR company because expansion (customers adding more workers, new countries, or new products) exceeds contraction and churn, creating a net positive revenue movement from the existing customer base.

**A5.** Three reasons for discrepancy: (1) Self-serving bias — AEs blame external factors (price, features) rather than their own selling (poor discovery, weak champion building). (2) Simplified narratives — AEs pick one reason when the actual decision involved multiple factors weighted differently. (3) Incomplete information — AEs may not know the full decision process, especially in enterprise deals with procurement involvement they did not see. Buyer-stated reasons (from neutral third-party interviews) are more reliable because the buyer has no incentive to protect the AE's ego and can provide the full decision context.

**A6.** Magic Number = Net New ARR / Prior Quarter Sales & Marketing Spend = $3.2M / $4.5M = 0.71. Interpretation: for every dollar spent on sales and marketing, the company generates $0.71 in new annual recurring revenue. This is below the 0.75 efficiency threshold and signals that sales and marketing spend may need optimization — either improve conversion rates, increase deal size, or reduce spend. Above 1.0 is considered excellent and may indicate under-investment in growth.

**A7.** (a) Discounted PEPM: $599 x (1 - 0.15) = $509.15. (b) Gross margin per worker: $509.15 - $210 = $299.15/month. (c) Gross margin percentage: $299.15 / $509.15 = 58.8%. This is above the typical 50%+ threshold for owned entities, so the discount is margin-acceptable, but the AE should document whether the discount actually influenced the win — if not, it was unnecessary margin erosion.

**A8.** Three expansion signals: (1) The customer posts job listings in countries where they do not currently have EOR workers — detectable via LinkedIn/Indeed job posting monitoring. (2) Platform usage increases — more admin users logging in, HR team exploring country cost calculators or benefits pages for new countries. (3) The customer's CSM or account team receives direct inquiries about pricing or onboarding timelines for additional countries or workers. Additional signals include funding events, executive hires in international roles, and support tickets asking about specific country compliance.

**A9.** Because EOR revenue begins when workers are active on payroll, not when the contract is signed. A deal closed-won in March but with workers starting in May means no revenue for March or April. If the analytics team counts March closed-wons as March revenue, the forecast will be systematically wrong. Tracking the gap (closed-won to first payroll) also reveals operational bottlenecks — if onboarding takes 45 days when it should take 14, that is a problem for both revenue timing and customer experience.

**A10.** Partner-sourced means the partner originated the opportunity — the prospect was not in the pipeline before the partner introduced them. Partner-influenced means the deal was already in the pipeline (from direct sales or another channel) and the partner provided endorsement, references, or co-selling support. This distinction matters for economics because: sourced deals command higher commission (the partner did the demand generation work), influenced deals get lower commission (the partner added value but did not create the opportunity), and double-counting sourced deals that were actually influenced inflates partner program ROI and creates budget misallocation.

**A11.** NRR = ($8M + $2.4M - $0.6M - $0.48M) / $8M = $9.32M / $8M = 116.5%. GRR = ($8M - $0.6M - $0.48M) / $8M = $6.92M / $8M = 86.5%. Expansion rate = $2.4M / $8M = 30%. Logo retention rate = (200 - 16) / 200 = 92%. The 116.5% NRR indicates healthy expansion that more than offsets churn and contraction, while the 86.5% GRR suggests there is room to improve retention.

**A12.** Dashboard factory syndrome occurs when the analytics team builds dozens of dashboards in response to every stakeholder request, resulting in a proliferation of reports that nobody consistently uses and that require ongoing maintenance. Symptoms include: 30+ dashboards with <5% weekly active usage, conflicting metrics across dashboards, and the analytics team spending 80% of time on dashboard maintenance instead of insight generation. To avoid it: (1) co-design a small set of core dashboards (3-5) with sales leadership, (2) require usage metrics before building new dashboards, (3) sunset dashboards with low adoption after 90 days, (4) invest in self-serve data access so users can explore without needing custom dashboards.

**A13.** PEPM is the visible service fee, but FX margin is often 30-50% of total gross margin. Example: A worker in India with a PEPM of $399 and a monthly salary conversion of $4,000 USD to INR. If the EOR applies a 1.5% FX markup, that generates $60/month in FX revenue — adding 15% on top of the PEPM. A deal at $350 PEPM (lower) with INR conversion could be more profitable than a deal at $400 PEPM with EUR conversion (where the FX markup is only 0.5% due to competitive pressure), because the FX margin on the INR deal is substantially higher. Pricing analytics must model total margin (PEPM + FX + float) not just PEPM.

**A14.** Recommended pipeline coverage for enterprise deals is 2-3x (lower than the 3-4x for mid-market). The difference exists because: enterprise deals are larger and fewer, making each deal a bigger percentage of quota; enterprise win rates are typically lower (more competitors, longer evaluations); but enterprise deals are better understood (named accounts, more data on each deal) so less excess pipeline is needed to compensate for uncertainty. Additionally, enterprise deals take longer, so coverage is measured over a longer horizon.

**A15.** Attending pipeline reviews provides three things a data export cannot: (1) Context — hearing the VP Sales discuss why a deal is stuck provides qualitative context that explains anomalies in the data (e.g., "the champion left the company" explains why activity dropped). (2) Credibility — being present demonstrates that you understand and care about the sales team's challenges, building trust that makes them more receptive to your insights. (3) Feedback loop — hearing how sales leaders react to (or ignore) your metrics tells you which analytics are useful and which are not, enabling you to iterate faster than if you just emailed a report.

## First 90 Days

## Days 1-30: Foundation

1. **Map the current state.** Inventory every sales dashboard, report, and data flow. Identify what exists, who uses it, and what is missing. Interview the VP Sales, 3 sales managers, and 5 AEs to understand their data needs and frustrations.

2. **Audit CRM data quality.** Pull a sample of 100 opportunities. Check: field completeness, stage accuracy, close date reasonableness, competitor field population, and activity logging. Quantify the data quality baseline — you need this number to show improvement later.

3. **Attend pipeline reviews.** Shadow at least 4 weekly pipeline reviews (different teams/segments). Do not present or speak unless asked. Listen. Understand the cadence, the vocabulary, the politics, and the gaps where data would help.

4. **Build CRM-to-warehouse reconciliation.** Before you build any dashboard, ensure your data warehouse matches the CRM. If the VP Sales sees a different pipeline number in your dashboard than in Salesforce, you have lost credibility before you start. Reconciliation must be automated and checked daily.

5. **Identify the top 3 unanswered questions.** From your interviews, identify the three most important questions sales leadership cannot currently answer with data. These become your first projects.

## Days 31-60: Core Capabilities

6. **Build the real-time pipeline dashboard.** Co-design it with the VP Sales and one sales manager. Include: pipeline by stage, weekly changes (created/closed/lost/pushed), forecast comparison, and risk deals. Get it reviewed in a pipeline meeting and iterate based on feedback.

7. **Implement pipeline hygiene reporting.** Build an automated weekly report that flags: stale deals (no activity in 30+ days), deals past close date, deals missing required fields, and deals with no next steps. Send to sales managers with the expectation that they address flagged issues.

8. **Deliver your first forecast.** Produce a stage-weighted pipeline forecast alongside AE commit totals. Present both to the VP Sales and discuss the delta. This establishes analytics as a forecasting partner, not just a reporting function.

9. **Begin win/loss data collection.** If close reasons are not being systematically captured, implement required fields and picklists on opportunity close. Design the win/loss analysis framework (even if you do not have enough data yet to populate it).

## Days 61-90: Advanced Capabilities

10. **Territory analysis.** Analyze territory balance — TAM, pipeline, and existing customer distribution across reps. Present findings and recommendations to sales leadership. This is typically a high-impact early win because most territory designs have significant imbalance.

11. **Build the first deal scoring model.** Using historical data (even 6-12 months is enough for a simple model), build a logistic regression that predicts deal close probability based on stage, age, segment, and activity. Compare it to static stage-based probabilities. Present the improvement to sales leadership.

12. **Establish the operating rhythm.** Formalize your participation in: weekly pipeline reviews (with analytics pre-read), monthly sales performance reviews (with rep scorecards), and quarterly planning (with segment and territory analysis). Get these meetings on the calendar and committed to by sales leadership.

13. **Deliver your first win/loss analysis.** Even with limited data, present initial findings: overall win rate, top loss reasons, win rate by competitor (if enough volume). Include 2-3 specific, actionable recommendations. This positions analytics as a strategic partner, not just a dashboard provider.

## How This Module Makes You Valuable as an Analytics Leader

Understanding sales analytics and GTM operations positions you as a uniquely valuable analytics leader:

- **Sales Partnership Credibility**: You speak the language of pipeline, quota attainment, and win rates — earning trust from CROs and sales VPs who typically dismiss analytics teams as too removed from revenue reality.
- **Pipeline Intelligence Architecture**: You design systems that transform raw CRM data into forward-looking pipeline signals, giving sales leadership the predictive visibility they need to act before quarters close.
- **Revenue Forecasting Precision**: You bring statistical rigor to forecast calls that are typically driven by gut instinct and rep optimism, reducing forecast variance and giving the CFO confidence in revenue projections.
- **Rep Productivity Optimization**: You identify the behaviors, sequences, and timing patterns that separate top performers from the middle of the pack — enabling sales enablement to scale what actually works.
- **Territory and Segment Strategy**: You use data to design territories that balance opportunity with capacity, ensuring equitable coverage and maximizing market penetration across segments.
- **Win/Loss Pattern Recognition**: You move beyond anecdotal deal reviews to systematic win/loss analysis, surfacing the competitive dynamics, pricing sensitivities, and buyer objections that shape win rates.
- **GTM Alignment Facilitation**: You provide the shared metrics and single source of truth that align sales, marketing, and customer success around common definitions of pipeline health and revenue performance.
- **Quota and Compensation Analytics**: You bring analytical rigor to quota-setting and compensation design — two of the most politically charged processes in any company — grounding decisions in data rather than negotiation.

*Sales analytics expertise is rare among analytics professionals. By mastering these concepts, you bridge the gap between go-to-market execution and data-driven decision making — becoming the partner that every CRO wishes they had on their team.*
