## Module Summary

If modules 1 through 10 taught you how the EOR/COR machine operates — payroll, compliance, treasury, data platforms — this module teaches you how the machine acquires customers. Everything you learned about gross-to-net calculations and statutory filings means nothing if nobody is buying the service. Sales is where the revenue engine starts, and analytics is what keeps it tuned.

The EOR/COR industry is intensely competitive. Deel, Remote, Papaya Global, Multiplier, Rippling, Oyster, and a dozen smaller players are all fighting for the same buyers: companies that want to hire across borders without setting up legal entities. The difference between winning and losing deals often comes down to speed (how fast can you onboard a worker?), coverage (do you have an entity in the country the buyer needs?), and trust (can the buyer believe you will pay their workers correctly every single month?). Analytics powers all three.

As an analytics leader, your relationship with sales leadership is one of your most important stakeholder partnerships. The VP of Sales wants to know: Are we going to hit our number this quarter? Which deals are at risk? Where should we hire our next reps? Which segments should we pursue? These are all analytics questions disguised as sales questions.

This module covers:

- How EOR/COR companies sell — the sales models, buyer personas, and sales cycle mechanics that define the go-to-market motion
- Pipeline and funnel analytics — the conversion math that tells you whether the demand engine is healthy
- Sales productivity and quota analytics — the rep-level economics that determine whether your sales team is efficient
- Pricing analytics — how deal pricing, discounting, and competitive pressure affect margin
- Sales operations infrastructure — the CRM data quality and process compliance that make all other analytics possible
- Partner and channel analytics — how indirect sales and referral programs contribute to growth
- Expansion and upsell analytics — why existing customers are the most important revenue source in EOR
- Win/loss analysis — the systematic review process that turns lost deals into competitive intelligence
- Building the Sales-Analytics partnership — what great looks like when data and sales work together

**Why this matters for an analytics leader:** You will not survive in this role if your relationship with sales is transactional ("send me a dashboard"). The best analytics leaders are embedded in the sales rhythm — they attend pipeline reviews, they build forecast models that sales leadership trusts more than gut feel, they surface insights that change territory strategy. This module teaches you how to be that partner.
