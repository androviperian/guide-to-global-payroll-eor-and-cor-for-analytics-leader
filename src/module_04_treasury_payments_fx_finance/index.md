## Module Summary

Modules 1-3 covered the operating model, worker data, and payroll calculation. But calculating the right amount is only half the job -- **getting the money to the right person, in the right currency, on the right date** is the other half.

This module covers the financial plumbing of global payroll: how money flows from the client through the platform to the worker, how foreign exchange is managed, how payments are executed across dozens of banking systems, and how finance controls ensure nothing leaks, nothing is double-paid, and everything reconciles.

For an analytics leader, this module is critical because:
- **FX is a hidden profit center** (and risk center) for most platforms
- **Cash forecasting** is one of the highest-value analytics deliverables
- **Billing leakage** (charging less than you should) is a direct margin hit
- **Financial controls** are what auditors examine most closely
- **Treasury operations** generate rich data that most companies under-utilize for strategic insight
